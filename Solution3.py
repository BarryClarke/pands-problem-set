#Program to print all numbers between 1000 and 10000 that are divisible by 6 but not by 12

i = 1000

# Double while loop cuts down the calculations required, improving efficiency
# 1st while loop finds the first number >= 1000 that is disvisible by 6
while i <= 1006:
  if i % 6 != 0:
    i = i + 1
  else:
    # 2nd while loop checks if number is divisible by 12, then adds 6 to this number
    while i <= 10000:
      if i % 12 != 0:
        print(i)
      i = i + 6
